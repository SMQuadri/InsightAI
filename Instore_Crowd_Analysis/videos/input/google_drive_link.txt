The input video I used is around 30MB in size wheresas the maximum size limit of a file that can be uploaded in a github repository is 25MB.
I couldn't directly upload the video inside the input folder. 
Instead I uploaded the input video in google drive and you can access it through the link given above.
For code execution, download the video, then paste it here inside the input folder. Also, delete this google_drive_link.txt file.
Folder structure should be like,
Instore_Crowd_Analysis > videos > input > crowd.mp4

___InsightAI is an artificial intelligence powered software which helps the retailers to grab useful insights and monitor them in real-time so as to enhance customers' shopping experience. During this ongoing pandemic crisis, the retailers need to be more concerned about the maximum limit of people in the store or a specific area and also maintain social distancing between them to follow the safety norms. The retailers can monitor this in real-time as InsightAI has built-in automated algorithms which monitors the people count inside the store and also checks social distancing between people inside the store. The retailers can also specify the maximum threshold for this, which on getting exceeded would automatically initiate an alert email to them in real-time. Apart from this, InsightAI has various other features like, an excel sheet gets created at the end of each session which can be used for footfall analysis, automatic enabling of timer and session scheduler etc. InsightAI is built so as to accept diverse set of arguements during runtime. It is a scalable software and is capable of running over varied inputs like pre-recorded videos, live video through a webcam or even a connected ip camera. InsightAI has a built in video writer which can be used by the retailers to permanently store output videos to local disk.___

## InsightAI software modules :
* ___Store Entry/Exit Analysis___
* ___Instore Crowd Analysis___

----

# (1) Store Entry/Exit Analysis :
InsightAI monitors and analyzes the store's entrance/exit point. It counts the number of people entering and leaving the building and the total number of people present in the building at any instance and provides realtime analysis in the form of a GUI. It also sends an email alert if the number of people present in the building at that moment exceeds a given threshold. An excel sheet also gets created at the end of the session which contains some quite useful data that can be used by the administrator for footfall analysis. The administrator can also setup the timer (session's max time limit) and scheduler (automatically starts the session at the scheduled date and time). Output video gets generated and stored permanently on local disk and can be viewed by the admin anytime.

> ### Environment used:
* Anaconda
* Jupyter

> ### Packages and dependencies:
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* imutils
* datetime
* schedule
* opencv-python
* dlib (You need to install cmake globally prior to dlib installation)
* jupyter notebook
* ipykernel

> ### Implementation steps:
* Virtual environment setup in anaconda
* Obtaining input video (prerecorded video or webcam)
* Image preprocessing and blob inferencing
* Training the MobileNetSSD neural network
* Construction of centroid tracking algorithm
* Creating a trackable object
* Implementation of people counter
* Writing output frames to a video file on disk
* Implementing people's log file, mail alert, timer and scheduler setup and max threshold functionalities

> ### Features:
* InsightAI is capable of running over both input videos as well as in realtime through webcam or ip-cameras, giving a higher FPS throughput rate than even yolo and r-cnns
* The software user (or) the store administrator can even enable mailer functionality. Doing this, they will receive an email alert if the number of people present in the store exceeds the specified threshold.
* I have also provided a functionality, which on enabling results in the automatic creation of a log file (excel sheet/csv file) at the end of the session, which would be helpful for footfall analysis.
* The user can also setup the timer upto which the video runs and then stops automatically.
* Keypresses are also captured and are handled correspondingly.
* Video summarization text is displayed on the window.
* Output frames can be written to a video file on local disk for permanent storage(if the user specifies --output arguement during run-time). The output video can be recorded in any supportive format like avi, mkv, mp4v.
* Automatic cleanup work is also done at the end of the session.

# (2) Instore Crowd Analysis:
InsightAI monitors the crowd inside the store. The admin can specify the ROI limit which indicates the area needed to be monitored for analysis. It detects the movement of people inside those the store, calculates the distances between them, analyzes the people violating social distancing and provides the reults in the form of a GUI to the adminstrator in realtime. The admin also gets an email alert if the total number of people violating social distancing exceeds a given threshold. As in Store Entry/Exit analysis module the admin can set the timer & scheduler and can also access the output video anytime later from the local storage.

> ### Environment used:
* Anaconda
* Jupyter

> ### Packages and dependencies:
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* datetime
* schedule
* opencv-python
* jupyter notebook
* ipykernel

> ### Implementation steps:
* Virtual environment setup in anaconda
* Obtaining input video (prerecorded video or webcam)
* Frame differencing and image preprocessing
* Training the YOLO neural network (___Note:___ You need to download YOLO weight file and paste it into the __model__ folder inside __Instore_Crowd_Analysis__. Its file size is around 250MB and hence I couldn't upload it in the repository. You can dowload the weight file from the given or any other preferred link. https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights_ )
